# iss_utility_list
Cybersecurity is a vast domain. It is really difficult for beginner to find their way. To help them start their journey or to remind older members of the community, I create a list of all ressources that can help us.
You can use freely this database.

They are presented in [https://www.datatatemplar.fr](https://datatemplar.fr/veille/). On the page, you will have the possibility to filters the results.

I hope you will make a lot of pull requests to improve this database.

# Propose an item to the list
You can propose a modification of an existing file or create a new one in order to add an item to the list. An object is represented by a YAML file. You just need to follow this template.
If you are an expert with github, just fork the project and make a pull request to integrate your changes.
If you are a beginner, you can create an [issue](https://github.com/datatemplar/iss_utility_list/issues/new/choose) by following this link or in the top menu.

```yaml
